# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Kevin Li

This project is envisioned as a film and media tracker used for 
controlled organization of a set of films that have been watched or wish to be watched. It will be useful to those who
consume feature-length
media, TV-shows and animation as a simple but effective method to keep their view history tidy and trackable.

This project is of interest to me as I am an avid film buff and consume a wide variety of media, 
from short films to documentaries to Japanese and Western animation. I want to create a program
that is able to track all the shows and films I have watched, and sort them by the criteria I provide. Such a
program would help me better understand the types of media I enjoy, and at the same time provide me with examples
of films for certain genres or styles to recommend to those around me.
